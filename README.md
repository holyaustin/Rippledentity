## Identity and Payment through Abstraction

payer, the easiest way to send and receive crypto tokens.

Using payer, anyone can deposit and send tokens to another person whether or not they already have a crypto wallet with just a link. The kicker is… the link is a smart contract wallet!

payer is a lightweight non custodial wallet designed to make transferring digital assets as easy as sending a link. Someone with crypto can create a payer and send that link to anyone over any platform (text, discord, email, etc). The amazing thing is, the link is the smart contract wallet!

### How it Works

1. Create a payer Link
2. Share your payer Link
3. Claim Reward

e.g.,

Consider Bob wants to send money to Alice But he doesn’t know Alice Address or any other details.

payer trying to represent the idea of 'Digital Cash' better than any other cryptocurrency, asset or tool on the market today

### Inspiration

*There's still a tremendous amount of friction in crypto that holds back mainstream adoption. It's unreasonable to ask the general population to set up a 12- or 24-word seed phrase wallet, much less a hardware wallet, just to send a dollar or receive a commemorative NFT.*
